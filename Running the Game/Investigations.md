# Investigations

Investigations are when two groups of people are attempting to out smart each other while achieving an ultimate objective.  Investigations are broken into two groups; Investigators and Conspirators.

## Investigators

The goal of the Investigators is to gather the evidence necessary to discover the Conspirators goal, and to use that evidence to either stop the Conspirators from achieving their goal, or making sure they are tied to the conspiracy (served justice).

## Conspirators

The goal of the Conspirators is to set a goal and execute a plan to both achieve that goal, and get away with it.
