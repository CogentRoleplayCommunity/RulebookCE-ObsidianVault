# World-building & Adaptations

The following section are tools for taking a setting (existing or brand new), and adapting Cogent to the setting.  These tools will provide guidelines on how to created magic system, lists of equipment (weapons, armor, tools etc), and general guidelines to migrate existing rule sets to Cogent.  This section, more than any other section or chapter of the rules, must follow the first rule, and everything listed in this section must serve the Story first and foremost.  These are guildlines, not rules.

## Magic Systems

Within most stories, magic (or supernatural effects like advanced technology or super powers) is roughly divided into two broad categories; Hard Magic systems, and Soft Magic systems.  When you design your setting you must keep these in mind.  

* **Soft Magic:** Magic serves a thematic and narrative purpose within the story.  A defining characteristic of soft magic systems is that how the magic operates does not matter.  Characters use magic in an organic and natural way as per their Character, not based on the rules imposed on them.  An example of this would be that Unicorns have unlimited powers to remove corruption, poison, and toxins, but would never be able to cause them to any person.  Here are the guidelines to creating a soft magic system.
  1. **Magic should be thematic:** How a Character uses magic should serve the narrative feeling of the Character (ie the unicorn).
  2. **Magic should be used naratively:** Magic shouldn't be used to hand wave away problems, but instead as that last ditch effort to serve the story (ie Gandalf only uses the exactly right spell at the exactly right time when the situation is most dire, not when it is convenient).
* **Hard Magic:** Magic is a tool, with defined rules and restrictions.  As a tool, there is an inherent cost to using magic, and this needs to be reflected in your magic system.  How your magic work is critical, because it defines the limits on it's use.  Here are the guidelines to create a hard magic system.
  1. **Magic comes at a cost:** There must be a quantifiable cost for every use of magic.  This cost must be the same for all Characters at all times for the same magical effect (ie all fireball spells cost 100 Mana points to cast).
  2. **Magic is universal:** The rules define how magic is used, not the narrative.  The rules apply equally to all Characters (ie a fireball is a fireball is a fireball).

#### Magic Mechanics

**Magic as a Skill**

This is a good mechanic for a Soft Magic system.  Essentially you have one or more magic Specialisations within a magic using Vocation.  The Narrator would choose the CL based on the precieved difficulty of the act.  In a pure Soft Magic system, the CL should be based on how Naratively relevant the magic use is (ie a mage can't use an open door spell on every single door they come across, that destroys the tension and "fun" of the story).

*Drain Mechanic*

An alternative to *Magic as a Skill* is the drain mechanic.  Each spell (or spell like effect) has an IL (Injury Level).  Casting a spell could cause an Injury.  If you fall unconscience, the spell fails.
