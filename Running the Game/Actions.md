# Actions

An Action is initiated by a Player and will likely result in their Character having to make a Dice Roll.  The following rules apply to Actions:

* If the Dice Pool for a Dice Roll is greater than the CL for the Action, the Action is successful.
  * Narrative Failure does not make an Action unsuccessful, just costly, complicated, and/or with unforeseen consequences.
* A Narrator must tell the Player if the Action is impossible (ie the Dice Pool is equal or smaller than the CL).
* All Actions must be declared before a Dice Roll is performed.
  * Initiative is used to allow Characters to target another Character's Actions.
* Once declared, an Action can not be changed.  The Character will attempt the Action (even if impossible).
