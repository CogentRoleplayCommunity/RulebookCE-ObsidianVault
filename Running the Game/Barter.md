# Barter

A Barter encounter is any situation where two or more Characters are attempting to either buy or sell a product or service.  In most situations commerce follows the standard rules for Commerce Points.  Compare the IV (Item Value (ie cost)) of the product/service with the CP (Commerce Points) of the Character.

| **IV-CP** | **Buying** | **Selling** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| >0 | n/a | +(IV-CP) CP |
| 0 | -2 CP | -0 CP |
| -1 | -1 CP | -0 CP |
| -2 | -0 CP | -0 CP |

*Example:*
> Kelly is buying a sword from a merchant.  Both Kelly has 4CP and the merchant has 2CP.  The sword has a cost of 3 IV.
> 
> When Kelly purchases the sword from the merchant, the IV-CP is -1 (3-4) so Kelly's CP (buying) is reduced by -1 CP.  Kelly now has 3CP.
> 
> The merchant has an IV-CP of +1 (3-2) so the merchant's CP (selling) is increased by +(IV-CP)CP or +1 CP.  The merchant has 3CP.
