# Narrative Success and Failure

An Action succeeds or fails based on if the Character has a Dice Pool that is greater than the CL for the Dice Roll.  A Dice Roll is instead used to determine how well a Character succeeds or fails.

## Narrative Success

Each Win above the CL is considered a Narrative Success.  The higher the Narrative Success, the greater the outcome.  Here are some suggestions you can use:

* +1 Injury Level per Narrative Success.
* Increase the CL to detect the effects of the Action (Of course this door was untouched)
* Decrease the time needed to perform the Action (I got it on the first attempt!)
* ±1 Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Player's choice)
* Decrease the CP cost for an item or service
* Change the attitude or emotion of the target of your Action (Your powerful strike fills your opponent with fear.)

## Narrative Failure

Each Win below the CL is considered a Narrative Failure.  It is important to reiterate that Narrative Failures are not automatically failed Dice Rolls, just that the intended Action is more costly than desired.  The higher the Narrative Failure, the greater the cost.  Here are some suggestions you can use:

* +1 Injury Level per Narrative Failure to you.
* Decrease the CL to detect the effects of the Action (Did you hear something?)
* Increase the time needed to perform the Action (PC Load Letter, what the !@$% does that mean!)
* ± Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Narrator's choice)
* Increase the CP cost for an item or service
* Change your attitude or emotion because of your Action (That's not a good sound...)
