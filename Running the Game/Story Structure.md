# Story Structure

**Cogent Roleplay** attempts to follow the structure and flow you will find in book series, TV shows, or plays.  Most *Campaigns* (a collection of *Stories*) will follow (loosely) the following structure:

* **Campaign:** This is the the whole collective story the Players and their Characters engage in.  It is similar to the entire book series, then entire TV show (all seasons), or the full collection of related plays.  *Campaigns* typically take years to complete.
* **Story:** *Campaigns* are broken into *Story*.  Each *Story* could act as an independent *Campaign*, or build on other *Story* to tell a grand overarching narrative.  It is similar to a single book in the series, a single season of a TV show, or a single play.  *Story* will take anywhere between 1 month, to 1 year to complete.
* **Act:** To make telling *Stories* easier, *Chapters* are grouped into *Acts*.  *Acts* are similar to Acts in a play in that they break up the *Story* into logical narrative parts.  They have no game play impact and are only used by *Narrators* to make planning *Stories* and *Campaigns* easier.
* **Chapter:** *Story* are broken into *Chapters*.  *Chapters* typically have a single narrative arc (a problem for the Characters to overcome), and *Chapters* follow the standard Story build-up, climax, and resolution arc typical to most stories.  It is similar to a chapter in a book, a show in a TV series, or an act in a play.  You can expect a *Chapter* to take between 1-3 gaming sessions to complete.
* **Scene:** *Chapters* are broken into *Scenes*.  A *Scene* builds up to a single challenge or opportunity for the Characters involved.  Typically, you will have one major Dice Roll per *Scene*.  It is similar to a page in a book, a scene in a TV show, or play.
