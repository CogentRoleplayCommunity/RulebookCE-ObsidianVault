Injury Levels and Healing

When a Character takes damage they are given injuries.  Injuries are broken into three elements, an injury name, the injury category (Scrapes, Injuries, Wounds, and Trauma), and an injury Level (from 0-5).  Injuries have the following format:

[Name]  [injury level]  [penalty] *(example: Deep slash, Lvl 3, -3D6)*

| **Category** | **Injury Level** | **Penalty** | **Notes**       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Trivial      | 0                | -0D6        | Scrapes         |
| Trivial      | 1                | -1D6        | Bruises         |
| Wounded      | 2                | -2D6        | Minor Injury    |
| Wounded      | 3                | -3D6        | Moderate Injury |
| Trauma       | 4                | -4D6        | Serious Injury  |
| Trauma       | 5                | -5D6        | Dead            |

Anytime a Character is injured, they must check if they [succeed or fail](<Success Failure.md>) an Endurance skill check vs the total of all injury levels the Character has.  If they will automatically fail, they fall unconscious.

> Bob the boxer has endured through 6 grueling rounds, and has now been hit with a devastating uppercut.
> 
> Bob previously had 2 Level 1 injuries, 1 Level 2 injury, and now has received a Level 3 injury.  Bob has a total of 7 injury levels (1 + 1 + 2 + 3).
> 
> Bob's Endurance Dice Pool is 3D6 + 2D6(STR) + 2D6 (Endurance) or 7D6.  7D6 is not greater than 7CL, so Bob falls to the mat unconscious.

#### Injury Category

There are three injury categories [Trivial, Wounded, and Trauma].  An injury is a Trivial injury if the injury level is 0 or 1, an injury is a Wound if the injury level is 2 or 3, and an injury a Traumatic injury if the injury level is 4 or greater.

#### Healing

There are three types of healing [Natural healing, Medical treatment, and Emergency Care].  Regardless of the type of healing, the CL for the healing check is always the total of all injury levels the patient (injured Character) has.  

**Natural Healing:** Typically once per Chapter a Character may declare they are *Naturally Healing*.  The Character makes an Endurance skill check, with one of two outcomes:

* **Narrative Success:** A Trivial injury is reduced by -1 (removing the injury if the Injury Level is less than 0) per Narrative Success.
* **Narrative Failure:** A non-trivial injury is increased by +1 per Narrative Failure (the same injury can not be increase more than once).

**Medical Treatment:** Medical treatment requires the use of a [Specialization](<../Playing the Game/Skills.md>) and adequate medical supplies.  Typically a Character can attempt medical treatment on a patient (target Character) once per Chapter.  Narrative Success or Failure affects how long the medical treatment takes (with Narrative Failure increasing the number of days the Character needs treatment).  Medical Treatment reduces the highest non-traumatic injury by -1.

**Emergency Care:** Unlike other methods of healing, emergency care can be used multiple times per Chapter on the same patient.  Each time a Character performs emergency care on a patient (target Character), they are making an injury permanent (ie sacrifice the limb to save the body).  Narrative Success reduces the injury level before it becomes permanent, Narrative Failure increases the injury level of the injury, but the Character may attempt another round of Emergency Care (or lose the patient).  Due to the high risk the patient may die, most emergency care is done as a [collaborative roll](<../Playing the Game/Assists and Collaborations.md>).
