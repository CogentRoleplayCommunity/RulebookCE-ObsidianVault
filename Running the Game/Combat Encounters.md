# Combat Encounters

Combat is when two or more Characters are attempting to use violence in an encounter.  Combat primarily uses Initiative as the core mechanic.  Narrators should consider the additional components.

## Combat Range

Combat Ranges are not absolute distances, but effective engagement ranges.  There are five combat ranges:

* **Grapple:** When two or more Characters are in physical contact with each other.  Unless stated otherwise, weapons designed to be used at Thrown, Ranged, or Artillery range, can not be used in grapple range.
* **Melee:** When two or more Characters can easily hit each other with a couple of steps (typically within the same room of a building).  
* **Thrown:** The typically distance that a Character can throw a rock, spear, or dart effectively (typically within 50 yards/meters).  
* **Ranged:** The effective range of a non-thrown weapon (bow, firearm, sling, etc), where distinguishing features can still be made out (typically within 100 yards/meters).  At this range and beyond, melee and grapple weapons can not be used.
* **Artillery:** Any distance beyond Ranged range is considered Artillery.  Weapons that are effective at this range typically use spotters (Assist Action), technology (scopes), or magic (scrying) in order to lock onto a target and hit them.

## Weapons and Armor

Weapon damage is a combination of three elements, the damage modifier (made up of an Attribute and a number from 0-3), the damage type (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing), and the primary range (grapple, melee, thrown, ranged, artillery).  Weapons damage is denoted using the following format:

[Attribute] + [damage modifier]  [damage type]  [primary range] *(example: INT+2 Slashing Melee)*

*As the Narrator you may add additional damage types to your settings.*

Armor is is a combination of two elements, the Armor Points (AP) (with a value from 1-5), the damage type (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing).  When a Character receives an Injury Level, they may choose to spend AP to reduce the Injury Level by that amount (ie -1AP per -1 Injury Level).  If the damage type of the armor matches the damage type of the weapon causing the injury, any AP spent is instantly recovered.  AP spent is recovered at the beginning of every scene.  Armor is denoted using the following format:

[AP]  [damage type] *(example: 4AP Piercing)*

*Most settings will give Armor a trait value that gives the wearer a Dice Pool penalty when worn.  This is to denote the encumbrances of the armor.*

## Combat Roll CLs

As a Narrator you must assign the CL for all Dice Rolls based on what works best for the Story, Setting, and the situation around the Dice Roll.  The following is a guide to help in that process.  

* **Combat Range VS Primary Range:** Compare the combat range of the target with the primary range of the weapon.  For each range difference apply a +1CL penalty.
  * **+0 CL:** Combat Range matches Primary Range
  * **+1 CL:** Grapple to Melee, Melee to Grapple or Thrown, Thrown to Melee or Ranged, Ranged to Thrown or Artillery, or Artillery to Ranged
  * **+2 CL:** Grapple to Thrown, Melee to Ranged, Thrown to Grapple or Artillery, Ranged to Melee, or Artillery to Thrown
  * **+3 CL:** Grapple to Ranged, Melee to Artillery, Ranged to Grapple, or Artillery to Melee
  * **+4 CL:** Grapple to Artillery, or Artillery to Grapple
* **Combat Modifiers:** Different combat maneuvers, field conditions, or positions offer advantages or disadvantages.
  * **Attacking while Prone (based off Primary Range) (laying down):** Grapple (+2 CL), Melee (+1 CL), Ranged (-1 CL), Artillery (-2 CL)
  * **Attacking someone that is Prone (based off of Combat Range):** Grapple (-2 CL), Melee (-1 CL), Thrown (+1 CL), Ranged (+2 CL), Artillery (+3 CL)
  * **Attacking from a superior position (ie higher ground):** This will be a -1 to -3 CL advantage (Narrators discretion).  Typically it will be a lower bonus. 
  * **Weapon Traits:** Some weapons will have traits that provide a benefit or penalty to a CL.  Use the weapon trait rules as applicable.
* **Movement:** The faster a your target moves, the harder it is to hit them.  Narrators should modify these penalties if the target is moving towards or away from the Character.
  * **Walking Speed:** +1 CL
  * **Running Speed:** +2 CL
  * **Dodging/Sprint Speed:** +3 CL
