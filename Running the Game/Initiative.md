# Initiaitve

Unlike other TTRPGs, Cogent Roleplay uses a reverse order Initiative.  This is because Characters can not change Actions after they are declared, and Characters can target another Character's declared Action as part of their Action.  There are four ways to determine a Character's Initiative score:

1. **Attritional Initiative:** The Character is attempting to both endure the challenges they are facing, and are relying on muscle memory to drive their Actions.
   * These Characters use their STR score as their Initiative.
2. **Reactive Initiative:** The Character is relying heavily on their senses to react to threats and drive their Actions.
   * These Characters use their RFL score as their Initiative.
3. **Tactical Initiative:** The Character is analyzing the situation, and devising strategies to counter their opponents.
   * These Characters use their INT score as their Initiative.
4. **Manipulative Initiative:** The Character is attempting to control the emotional state of their opponents in better to gain an advantage in the situation.
   * These Characters use their CHA score as their Initiative.

## Running Initiative

1. Determine each Character's Initiative.
   * Not every Character will use the same type of Initiative at the same time.
   * The Initiative type may change in an Encounter based on all the Character's Actions.
2. Starting with the Character with the smallest Initiative, have the Player declare their Action.
   * If two or more Characters have a tied Initiative, have each Player declare their Actions one at a time, then follow up with the NPC's Actions.
   * Consider all Characters with the same Initiative to have declared their Actions at the same time (ie they can not target each other's Actions).
3. Have each Player determine their Character's Dice Pool, and make their Dice Roll.
4. Gather all the results and declare the outcome of the Initiative round.
5. Repeat until Initiative is no longer necessary.
