# Character Identity

You are playing a Character in a Story.  **Cogent Roleplay** encourages you to design your Character as if you are a writer, and start first with the Character Concept before moving onto the game rules.  This ensures your Character will be fun to play, and have a great story.

## Character Concept

Every Story setting has archetypes that are common for that setting.  An example of this is in D&D there are the 5 Character Classes (Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Bard, and Cleric).  Review your Story setting and understand what archetypes exist within the story.  Think about what Stores each archetype can tell, and which appeals to you the most.  Great Characters typically are twists on the original core archetypes (like the Barbarian Class in D&D), do not be afraid to mix things up for your Character.

Write down this Character Concept on your Character Sheet.

## Elevator Pitch

Now that you have a Character Concept, imagine that you are pitching the idea to a movie/book publisher.  You have only the time it takes an elevator to travel to the publisher's floor (maybe 2 min max) so you need to be clear and engaging.  An example would be,
> Olga was an orc that was raised in a human town, and never fit in.  One day bandits came to raid her town, and she was there to stop them.  Now Olga is the protector of her town, and she is seeking allies to protect those she loves the most.

Write your elevator Pitch on your Character Sheet.

## Flesh it Out

Write a short story about your Character, what they did prior to the events of the Story, what their motivations are, and what they want most in life.  Be sure that your short story includes the following:

* Where your Character was born and raised.
* Any allies and enemies your Character has made along the way.
* Your Character's "Call to Quest" (the event that set them on the motion to becoming a Character in the Story).
* Your Character's goal(s) in life (what do they want to be when they grow up?).
