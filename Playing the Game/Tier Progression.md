# Tier Progression
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

Every Character in a Story is expected to have a Narrative Arc.  Each Character is expected to learn and grow from their experiences, and eventually develop into the idealised version of themselves.  While the Story itself will cover each Character's Narrative Arc through gameplay, **Tier Progression** covers the mechanics of experience and growth.

A typical **Cogent Roleplay** campaign is broken into four parts (Campaign, Story Arcs, Chapters, and Scenes) *(see **[Story Structure](<../Running the Game/Story Structure.md>)**)*.  Character can expect (but are not entitled to) the following reward per campaign part:

* **Scene:** Typically no reward
* **Chapter:** Some Characters may receive **+1 Skill Point** for significant Character Growth.
* **Story:** Typically all Characters increase their **Tier** by one level.
* **Campaign:** Typically this is the end of the Story and their are no rewards.  However all Campaign Characters should become Legends within the Setting.

There are six **Tiers** within **Cogent Roleplay**.  The Players and Narrator will agree on the **Tier** for the Story before **Character Creation**.  Most One-Shot Stories will be set at **Tier 2 - Adventurer**.

| Tier | Name | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Beginning | Only for specific Stories with weak Characters (like horror Stories). |
| 1 | New Adventurer | "Call to Adventure!"  Standard starting point for most epic length campaigns.  Characters are weaker than most typical Cogent Characters. |
| 2 | Adventurer | "Crossing the Threshold!"  Starting point for most One-Shot Stories.  The average Cogent Character is in this Tier. |
| 3 | Veteran | "The Ordeal!"  These Characters have a backstory, and overcome challenges.  They are more powerful than the average Cogent Character. |
| 4 | Hero | "The Return!"  These Characters have completed at least one Campaign and are known in areas of the Story Setting.  They are some of the most powerful Characters in a Story Setting. |
| 5 | Legend | "God Tier!"  These Characters are Legends within the Story Setting, and their presence will dictate the course of action in a Story.  These Characters should only be reserved for specific Stories. |
