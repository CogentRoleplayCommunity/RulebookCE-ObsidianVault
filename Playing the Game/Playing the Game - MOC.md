# Playing the Game

The following chapter covers the basic rules that Players will need to play the game.  *Narrators* will have additional rules and tools in the *Running the Game* chapter.

The first and most important rule of *Cogent Roleplay* is; **The Story Comes First!**  If at any time these rules will intefere with the Players and Narrator from collaboratively telling the Story, put the rules aside and tell the Story.  These rules are guidelines to help you tell the Story.
