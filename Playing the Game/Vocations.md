# Vocations

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **VP** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **Max VP** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 |

Within **Cogent Roleplay**, **Vocations** fill the same role as Archetypes or Classes in other TTRPGs.  They are the profession your Character has been trained in.  It is assumed that your Character knows all the essentials of your **Vocation** to the level they are currently trained to (Apprentice for 1 rank, Journeyman fo 2 ranks, Tradesmen for 3 ranks, and Master for 4 ranks).

Depending on your starting **Tier** of play *(see **[Tier Progression](<Tier Progression.md>)**)* use the table above to determine your staring **Vocation Points (VP)**.  These can only be assigned to **Vocation** ranks, and can not be used for Skills, or Specialisations.  Depending on your starting **Tier** of play, Characters can only have a maximum **VP** per **Vocation**.  
Characters will be allowed to use **Skill Points (SP)** as **VP** at any time, but the restriction for the maximum **VP** per **Vocation** remains.
