Within TTRPG games, an **Attribute** describes a Character's specific natural characteristic.  **Cogent Roleplay** uses four **Attributes**; 
* **Strength (STR):** For interactions that manipulate the physical world.
* **Relfex (RFL):** For interactions to move through the physical world.
* **Intelligence (INT):** For mental interactions.
* **Charisma (CHA):** For social interactions.

Depending on your starting **Tier** of play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)* use the table above to determine your staring **Attribute Points (AP)**.  These can be assigned to any of the **Attributes**.  There are no restrictions on how many **AP** can be assigned per **Attribute**, only that you have a limited number of **AP** across all your **Attributes**.
