# Narrator Declares the CL

A *Challenge Level* (CL) is a representation of the difficulty of the a Dice Roll.  All Dice Rolls that are attempted succeed (regardless of the dice roll), however rolling poorly has consequences to future rolls and will raise the stakes in a Story.  Based on Dice Probability, the typical CLs you will see are:

| **CL** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Called an Open Roll.  This is a Dice Roll with no chance of consequences. |
| 1 | Low Risk.  This is a Dice Roll with little chance of consequences. |
| 2 | Lower Risk.  This is a Dice Roll with some chance of consequences. |
| 3 | Standard Risk.  Most roles will have a 3CL rating.  This Dice Roll has an average risk of consequences. |
| 4 | Higher Risk.  This is a Dice Roll with a higher chance of consequences. |
| 5 | High Risk.  This is a Dice Roll with likely chance of consequences. |
| 6 | Critical Risk.  Any CL greater than CL5 has an almost certan likelyhood of consequences. |

The consequences from a Dice Roll will varry from Dice Roll to Dice Roll, but will be relevant to the Action being performed.  The Narrator may indicate possible consequences to the Player prior to a Dice Roll.
