# Calculate Narrative Success or Failure

If a Character has a **Dice Pool** that is greater than the CL, the Character is capable of completing the task at hand.  Making a dice roll determines how well they accomplish the task at hand.  This is determined by calculating *Wins* and *Losses*, and comparing them to the CL.

* **Wins and Loses**
  When rolling a D6 if the results is a 4, 5, or 6, then it is considered a **Win**, otherwise it is considered a **Loss**.
* **Advantage and Disadvantage**
  Before making a dice roll, the Narrator may declare that the **Dice Pool** has *Advantage*, or *Disadvantage*.<br/>
  If the **Dice Pool** has *Advantage*, then a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 is considered a **Win**.<br/>
  If the **Dice Pool** has *Disadvantage*, then a roll of 5, or 6 is considered a **Win**.
* **Narrative Success or Failure**
  Narrative Success is when the Character generates more Wins than the CL.  The Narrator should treat Narrative Successes as strokes of luck (the lock takes less time to pick, the sword found the gap in the armour, the bard is inspired by their muse, etc), with higher Narrative Success being greater strokes of luck.<br/>
  Narrative Failure is when the Character generates less Wins than the CL.  The Narrator should treat Narrative Success as complications (the lock pick breaks, the sword deflects off the armour, the bard has writer's block, etc) and these complications will hinder the Character, but will not prevent them from accomplishing the task.

*Example*

> Erin the Mage wants to strategically cast a fireball into a group of goblins.  The Narrator determines that they will need to roll a Sorcery Specialisation check.
>
> * Erin's Player calculates Erin's **Dice Pool** as 5D6.  3D6 (Base) + 1D6 (Intelligence) + 1D6 (Mage Vocation) + 1D6 (Sorcery)
> * The Narrator reminds Erin's Player about their *Wand of Power* and tells them to add +1D6 to their **Dice Pool** for a total of 6D6.  Further to this, the Narrator tells them that the goblins are completely unaware of Erin's presence and they have *Advantage* on their **Dice Pool**.
> * Using the *Cheatsheet* as a guide, the Narrator feels that the fireball (a powerful spell) would be a significant strain on an average Mage.  The Narrator uses a **Dice Pool** of 4D6 and a difficulty of 31% pass rate to generate a CL 3.
> * Erin's Player rolls their dice and gets 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, and 5.  This generates 5 successes or a Narrative Success of +2.
>
> The fireball lands on the group of goblins and sets them all on fire.  The spell casting was so effective that the heat generated causes Medium Injuries (-2D6 Injury Penalty) to each of the goblins that are on fire.
