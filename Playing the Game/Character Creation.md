# Character Creation

The Character Creation process is the standard method to create new Cogent Characters.  There will be other Character Creation methods that will be introduced in specific Settings and Stories, but all methods are compatible with the standard method.  An overview of the process is:

* **[Character Identity:](<Playing the Game/Character Identity.md>)** Using a writer's tool, create your Character narratively.
* **[Attributes:](<Playing the Game/Attributes.md>)** Assign your Attribute Points.
* **[Vocations:](<Playing the Game/Vocations.md>)** Choose a Vocation, and Specialisations.
* **Skills:** Assign your Skill Points to Core Skills and Specialisations.
* **Purchase Equipment:** Assign Commerce Points, and purchase equipment (weapons, armour, tools, etc).
* **Finishing Touches:** Assign Destiny Points, and Characteristics. Share your Character with your group and Narrator for approval.
