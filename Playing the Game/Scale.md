# Scale

There will be times when the Characters face opponents that are larger or smaller than themselves, or they use tools or weapons that greatly increase their ability to manipulate the world around them.  This is called scale. <br/>
Any Character or Item that has a scale larger or smaller than the standard Player Character (ie human adult size) will be denoted with a scale modifier (either a positive or negative number).  Using the chart below, modify the Narrative Success/Failure accordingly.  

| **Target's Scale** | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 | +6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Result Adjustment** | +15 | +11 | +8 | +5 | +3 | +1 | +0 | -1 | -3 | -5 | -8 | -11 | -15 |

If two or more Characters have a scale modifier, adjust the scale modifiers for both Characters so that the smaller scale modifier is 0.  Only the results of the Dice Roll are modified, and Narrative Successes can not be turned into Narrative Failures (and vice versa).

*Example*

> An Ogre (+1 Scale) is trying to smash a Pixie (-1 Scale).  
> The Narrator adjusts the scale modifier for the Ogre to be +2 Scale, and the scale of the Pixie to be 0 Scale (setting the smaller scale to 0).
> The Ogre rolls Narrative Success of 0 and adds the +2 Scale modifier to get a total of Narrative Success of 2 (Level 2 Injury before Armour).
> The Pixie rolls a Narrative Success of 1 and subtracts the +2 Scale modifier to get a total Narrative Success of 0 (Narrative Success can not be turned to Narrative Failure) and deals a Level 0 Injury before Armour.
