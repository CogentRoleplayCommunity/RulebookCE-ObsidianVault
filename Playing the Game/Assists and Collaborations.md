# Assists and Collaborations

Many hands make quick work.  Within Cogent there are two methods that Characters can help each other out; the first is using *Assists*, and the second is using *Collaborations*.<br/>
**Assists** are when the results of on Character's dice roll, directly affects another Character's dice roll.  Whenever any Character declares they are making a dice roll, another Character can declare they are making an *Assist*.  They must declare how they are *Assisting*, and the Narrator will set the CL based on how likely the *Assist* will benefit the *Assisted* dice roll.  The Narrator may apply *Narrative Success or Failure* in the following ways:

* **Temporary Destiny Points:** The *Assisted* dice roll has their Destiny Pool increased or decreased for this dice roll only.
* **Modify the CL:** The *Assisted* dice roll has the CL increased or decreased as per the Narrator's discretion (*note: Narrators should convert the Narrative Success or Failure rather than use a straight 1 to 1 change to the CL*).
* **Add Modifier Dice:** The Narrative Success or Failure becomes *Modified* dice for the *Assisted* dice roll.

*Example*

> Rick the Ranger is setting up the campsite for the adventures.  To *Assist* in this, Paula the Paladin has decided to gather firewood, and Steve the Sorcerer has decided to use Sorcery to help start the fire.
>
> The Narrator has Paula make a Survival check against a CL 3 to find firewood, and she generates a Narrative Failure of -1 Narrative Failure (coming back short).
>
> The Narrator says this is a setback, but doesn't directly hinder Rick's attempts to set up camp (-1 Destiny Pool).
>
> Steve makes a Sorcery check against a CL 2 and generates +4 Narrative Successes.
>
> The Narrator says this is saves Rick a bunch of time trying to get the fire going and as a result the CL is reduced by -2 CL.  Rick makes his Wildcraft skill check against a new CL 1 (3-2) and generates +3 Narrative Successes.
>
> The Adventurers have a filling meal and a great nights rest.

**Collaborations** are when multiple Characters are attempting the same dice roll at the same time.  All the Characters will calculate their own **Dice Pools**, but the CL will be calculated for the group, not the individuals.  The Narrator will calculate the CL based on an average number of Characters or average ability and determine the, per individual, CL for the task.  The Narrator will then multiply this CL by the average number of Characters needed to get the CL for the group.

*Example*

> The portcullis is down and the Adventurers are attempting to escape.  Paula the Paladin encourages everyone by saying "All together now!" and everyone attempts to lift the portcullis.
>
> The Narrator states that if 4 Characters of average Athletics were to attempt this lift, it would be possible, but hard.  Looking at the *Cheatsheet*, a **Dice Pool** of 4D6 and a % chance to succeed of 31%, would set a CL 3.  The Narrator tells the group that the Collaboration CL is CL 3x4 or CL 12.
>
> The Adventurers make their rolls and get 3, 2, 2, 3 Wins each for a total of 10 Wins or -2 Narrative Failure.
>
> Since the combined **Dice Pools** of all the Adventurers is greater than the CL, the Narrator states that the portcullis isn't dropped properly when the go under, and each Adventurer gains a -2 Injury Level that can be reduced by armour.
