# Destiny Rolls

In many tabletop roleplaying games there is a need to make multiple dice rolls, one after another for effects that occur "off screen".  To prevent the Narrator and Players from having to roll more dice than absolute necessary, Cogent uses the **Destiny Roll**.<br/>
All **Destiny Rolls** are done with 1D20.  The CL for the **Destiny Roll** is based on the difficulty of combined tasks.

| **Difficulty (%)** | 5% | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CL** | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

The dice roll for the **Destiny Roll** must be equal or greater than the CL for the roll.  **Destiny Rolls** are mostly used by *Narrators* when the Actions of *NPCs* do not directly affect the *Players*.  This greatly speeds up gameplay and alows the story to move forward.

*Example*

> King John's men are traveling through Sherwood Forest with the latest taxes.  They know that Robin Hood and his Merry Men are planning to ambush the convoy, but King John's men have devised several new paths through the forest.<br/>
> The Narrator states that there is roughly a 75% chance that King John's men will hit one of the Merry Men's ambush points, but instead of rolling multiple navigation and perception skill checks, the Narrator decides to do a **Destiny Roll** instead.<br/>
> Since the Players are part of the Merry Men, the Narrator sets the CL at 16 (100% - 75% = 25%) and rolls 13 (a close failure).  The convoy rolls right into the ambush, but their agitated state means they were not fully caught unaware.
