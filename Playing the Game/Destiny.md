## Destiny Points

All Characters start with a number Destiny Points at the beginning of every Story based on the Tier of play, and get 1 Destiny Point per Chapter (1-3 sessions) of the Story, to a maximum as defined by the Tier.  Destiny Points are the mechanism for Players to "Spend Luck" during any Dice Roll.  There are two times that Destiny Points may be used, either before or after a Dice Roll.

**Before a Dice Roll**

Choose one per Destiny Point spent:
* Gain +1D6 to your **Dice Pool** for this roll.
* Gain **Advantage** on your **Dice Pool** (making 3-6 wins)
* Give the target of an opposed Dice Roll **Disadvantage** on their **Dice Pool** (making 5-6 wins)
* Do not roll, instead take 1/2 (round down) of your **Dice Pool** as your roll

**After a Dice Roll**

Choose one per Destiny Point spent:
* Throw away your Dice Roll, and roll your **Dice Pool** again.
* Increase a **Narrative Success** result (requires that the Dice Roll is a Narrative Success).
* Decrease a **Narrative Failure** results (can not turn a Narrative Failure to a Narrative Success).

**Restrictions**

* Temporary Destiny Points can only add dice to a **Dice Pool**, or reduce **Narrative Failure**.
* Destiny Points can only be spent on **Dice Pools** initiated by the Player.
