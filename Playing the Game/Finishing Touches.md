# Finishing Touches

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starting Destiny** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| **Max Destiny** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

**Cogent Roleplay** has a luck mechanic called **Destiny**.  **Destiny** is applied in two ways, first is the **Destiny Roll** *(covered later in Playing the Game)*, and the second is **Destiny Points**.  **Destiny Points** are used either before or after any **Dice Pool** roll, and directly affect the results of the roll.

Depending on your starting **Tier** of play *(see **[Tier Progression](<Tier Progression.md>)**)* use the table above to determine your staring **Destiny Points (Starting Destiny)**, and gain **1 Destiny Point** per Story Chapter (1-3 Sessions), up until the **Maximum Destiny (Max Destiny)**.

After your Character is done, share it with your Narrator and the other Players.  This gives the Group the ability to see your Character for the first time, and provide feedback.
