**Cogent Roleplay** uses **Commerce Points** as a method to track a Character's wealth.  **Commerce Points** are a combined measure of all salaries, inheritances, cash reserves, dept, and other non-tangible resources they can pull on.  

Depending on your starting **Tier** of play *(see **[Tier Progression](<Tier Progression.md>)**)* use the table above to determine your staring **Commerce Points (CP)**, but this can be modified with **Quirks of Wealth (Quirks)**.  Depending on your starting **Tier** Characters may have a maximum **Quirks**.  Taking a **Quirk of Wealth** increases the Character's **Commerce Points** by +1.  All **Quirks** come with restrictions that must be applied (or the Character will lose that Quirk and the associated +1 CP).
